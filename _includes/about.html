      <strong>Career interest:</strong>
      While I find programming and algorithmic design perfectly valid and interesting ends of themselves as a computer scientist, I can't help but feel like we should aspire to greater things. I've noticed a significant gap in communication skills between experienced computer scientists and developing computer scientists even at the collegiate level. I think the industry as a whole needs to change the way they think about documentation and teaching in general, since people can only be at their best if everyone is on the same page.</p>
       <strong>Hobbies:</strong>   
       Life is only fun if you live on the edge of your comfort zone. So I try to stay open minded about pretty much everything!</p>
    <p>   
       My hobbies include coffee, reading, hiking, biking, and snake charming.</p>
