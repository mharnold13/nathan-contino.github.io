                <p><b align="left">Career interest:</b>
                  I love programming and algorithmic design, but I can't help but feel like there are issues with the field that we've ignored for far too long. I've noticed a significant gap in communication skills between experienced computer scientists and developing computer scientists even at the collegiate level. I think the industry as a whole needs to change the way they think about documentation and teaching, since people can only be at their best if everyone is on the same page.</p><br/>
                <p><b align="left">Hobbies:</b>   
                  Life is only fun if you live on the edge of your comfort zone. So I try to stay open minded about pretty much everything!  
                  My hobbies include coffee, reading, hiking, biking, and creative writing.</p></p><br/>
