                <p><b align="left">Career interest:</b>
                  Computer Science is a fascinating field-- not only are we now doing things with Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography, and algorithms previously thought impossible, we're also helping people stay connected through things like the internet, providing almost anyone with the ability to learn through things like Wikipedia, Khan Academy, and modern search engines, and generally just trying to make the world a better place. Unfortunately, accomplishing all of that gets awfully confusing, and the individuals who seem best at accomplishing those things often have a lot of trouble clearing up the ensuing confusion in the minds of pretty much everyone else on the planet. Throughout my career, I hope to help brilliant computer scientists communicate better to make all of our lives easier-- and hopefully create some brilliant things along the way, too. Computer science isn't just about algorithms and math and typing things in a dark room in monospace fonts, it's about people, and all computer scientists should try to make the programming world a place where it's easy to understand things, effortless to find documentation, and possible to get hands-on help when something doesn't quite make sense. </p><br/>
                <p><b align="left">Hobbies:</b>   
                  Life is only fun if you live on the edge of your comfort zone. So I try to stay open minded about pretty much everything!  
                  My hobbies include coffee, reading, hiking, biking, and creative writing.</p></p><br/>
