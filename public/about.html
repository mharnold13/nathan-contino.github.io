I enjoy reading, writing, and coding. Not necessarily in that order. Currently based in Rochester, NY. Moving to NYC in May.
Appreciative of lightweight web pages. During my time at the University of Rochester, I held 8 TA positions, which I believe are essential to character growth and maturity during college.

<P>I love all things computer science, english, and philosophy. Hit me up for a cup of coffee and a book discussion.</P>
