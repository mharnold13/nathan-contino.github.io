  </P>
I enjoy reading, writing, and coding. Not necessarily in that order.
Currently based in Rochester, NY. Moved to NYC in May.
Appreciative of lightweight web pages. During my time at the University of
Rochester, I held 7 TA positions. Working as a workshop leader helped me
develop my passion for teaching as well as a great deal of personal and
professional skills, and I couldn't recommend the experience more.

<P>I love all things computer science, english, and philosophy. Hit me up for a cup of coffee and a book discussion.</P>
